Hello! this is my hypixel mod, where if you use the command /gc, it will prepend your message with a color
code of your choice.

to get this started, before you send any messages, make sure to do /setcolor [color code] to add a color 
to your messages. 

then after you do that, you should be good to go! 

??
NOTE:
you do need to have hytils (https://github.com/Sk1erLLC/Hytilities/releases) and have the 'short channel names' 
enabled to use color codes in guild chat or party chat

this also only works with guild chat! party chat maybe coming soon
??
